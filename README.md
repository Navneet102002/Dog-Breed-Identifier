# Dog-Breed-Identifier
The Machine Learning model can predict the probability of the type of dog breed in a photo.

In this project, I built a model that can identify the type of breed of a particular dog. The 
model used predictions from over 120 different dog breeds to predict the output. The dataset 
is taken from kaggle. The dataset contains over 10000+ images in training data and 10000+ 
images in test data.
